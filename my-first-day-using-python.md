# My First Day using Python

### Today is my first day to learn python 3.9.0

I am using VSCode to exicute my python code.

```
a=10
b=15
```

I have declared a and b as a datatype.

### code:

```
a=10
b=15
sum = a + b
multi =a * b
sub = a - b
div = a / b
mod = a % b
Power = a**3

if(a<b):
    print("a ",a," is smaller then b ",b);
```

In code i have used all the arithmetic operation which i know while exicuting the program.
